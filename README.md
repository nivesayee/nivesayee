Iâ€™m Niveditha, a data engineering Jedi, wielding the power of Python and the agility of Spark! When I'm not architecting data solutions, you can find me deep in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or enjoying the epic stunts of Rajnikanth. Recently, I've embarked on a new adventure into the world of blockchain technology.

## About Me

ðŸŒŒ **In a galaxy not so far away...**

I transform raw data into actionable insights, much like a Jedi turning Padawans into Masters. My toolkit includes a blend of programming languages, databases, ETL tools, and cloud services that make me a formidable force in the data universe.

ðŸ’¡ **Fun Fact:** When I'm not coding, I'm either binge-watching Star Wars, dissecting Marvel theories, or catching the latest Rajnikanth blockbuster.
